	<a href="/mysare/help/editRept.htm#assign" target="_blank"><h3>Assign Project Code</h3></a>
	<p>
	Use this feature to assign a new project code to a pi or co-pi that has not yet claimed his or her project. Persons who claim a project will be listed as a coordinator in the general information section. Do NOT assign new project codes to pis that have already claimed their project- they can access the project by logging into their MySARE account and clicking My Projects. A code can be used by more than one project coordinator to claim a project, but issuing a new project code will invalidate previously issued codes. When providing multiple coordinators with access, issue just one code, separating their email addresses with a comma.

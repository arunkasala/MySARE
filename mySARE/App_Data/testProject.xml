          <text>There are a few activities beyond the scope of this project that would provide further verification of the training project outcomes.  The first is a follow up survey to workshop participants evaluating whether or not they are still utilizing the training to provide (or planning to provide) information and assistance.  This survey could also be used to provide feedback from participants as to alternative training formats and materials that may better provide ongoing information once the workshop is completed.

	As a result of this survey, additional materials or information could be compiled and distributed to workshop participants.  These new materials would further assist workshop participants in their efforts to provide technical assistance to their communities.  A focus group comprised of members of the community who have received assistance from previous workshop participants would also be valuable in determining the overall ability of this training format to provide USDA field personnel with the resources needed to better assist their communities.</text>

          <text>As a result of this two-year project, American Farmland Trust, in collaboration with partners from the University of Maryland and the University of Delaware, developed and delivered a series of four workshops on land use and farmland protection issues targeted to Cooperative Extension, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCD), and other agricultural educators in the Delmarva Peninsula.    

This project was directed by the Delmarva Advisory Committee, which was comprised of key agricultural representatives from the region.  The advisory committee was responsible for developing the workshop agenda, identifying speakers and reviewing potential materials for the training workbook.  This committee played a pivotal role in the success of this project by helping to ensure that the workshop topics and the workbook materials were relevant and useful to the target audience.  The Delmarva Advisory Committee was comprised of representatives from Delaware Farm Bureau, Virginia and Maryland NRCS, Caroline County (MD) Department of Planning and Codes Administration, Maryland Division of Soil and Water Conservation, Delaware Office of State Planning Coordination, Delaware Department of Agriculture, Cecil County (MD) SWCD, Tankard Nurseries (VA), Maryland Department of Natural Resources, and Maryland and Delaware Cooperative Extension.

The advisory committee first met in September 1999 to discuss suggestions for the development of this training initiative.  The committee continued to meet through April 2000 to develop and finalize the workshop agenda and training workbook.  The four workshops were held on the following dates and at the following locations:
&#8226;	Wednesday, May 31, 2000- Crystal Inn, North East, MD 
&#8226;	Thursday, June 01, 2000- Kent County Cooperative Extension, Dover, DE
&#8226;	Tuesday, June 6, 2000- University of MD-Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, MD
&#8226;	Wednesday, June 7, 2000- Chesapeake College, Wye Mills, MD

Each of the four workshops covered two main themes.  The morning session was designed to examine the causes and the consequences of the loss of farmland both nationally and at the local levels.  Participants learned about the benefits that well-maintained agriculture has across the Delmarva, and some of the current problems that farmers are facing in the region.  Participants also learned how to acquire and utilize statistical data pertaining to demographic and land use issues.  Finally, participants were asked to break into small groups to discuss the various roles that they can play in determining the causes and consequences of farmland loss.
The afternoon session was designed to move beyond the discussion of why farmland protection was important and to focus on how farmland has been protected both nationally and in the Delmarva.  Topics included an overview of farmland protection tools used across the country, an overview of comprehensive land use planning in the region, and then a presentation on a specific local farmland protection program.  This session also concluded with a small group discussion about the different roles that each agency and organization could play in creating and implementing farmland protection programs.  

In addition to the workshops, each participant received resources to use in their local outreach efforts.  The advisory committee worked to develop the Delaware Farmland Protection Training Workbook (copies of this were sent to NE SARE previously.)  The workbook contains research and information from American Farmland Trust and members of the committee, including a detailed contact list, available data sources and statistics, Web resources, case studies, bibliographies, evaluations of state and local programs, and information on determining public attitude and creating community-based farmland protection programs.  In addition, the workbook contains 19 AFT fact sheets and six Maryland Cooperative Extension fact sheets, all &#8220;camera ready&#8221; in plastic sleeves so that they can be easily copied and handed out.  Finally, each workbook contained a color overhead of AFT&#8217;s Farming on the Edge map complete with a two-page presenter&#8217;s guide.

Each participant was also given a copy of AFT&#8217;s Saving American Farmland.  This book discusses the challenges of farming on the edge of development and illustrates the value of farmland to our nation, states and communities. It reviews techniques that state and local governments are using to protect farmland, as well as federal farmland protection policies. The book includes case studies of innovative and successful farmland protection programs in three states: California, Maryland and Washington.

	Finally, in order to ensure that participants had access to additional resources after the workshops, and to also ensure that they could download the presentations from the workshops, AFT gave each participant a free three-month subscription to LandWorks, American Farmland Trust&#8217;s subscription service for agricultural conservation professionals.  As part of this subscription, participants were given access to the LandWorks Web site, which contains the follow-up materials to these and other workshops and conferences as well as news about federal, state and local programs designed to protect farmland.  Participants received an issue of LandWorks Connection, a quarterly newsletter researched and written to give subscribers examples and analysis of farmland protection advancements, conservation programs and public, private and community actions.  Participants also received four hours of technical assistance provided by AFT&#8217;s Technical Assistance Service, where AFT staff provide information about farmland protection tools, recommend model documents, review draft ordinances, and provide updates on state and local farmland protection activities.</text>

          <text>There were a total of 92 participants combined for the four workshops.  While the workshop attendance was smaller than the attendance at similar workshops conducted in other states (approximately 23 people per workshop in the Delmarva, 35 people per workshop in Ohio, and 50 people per workshop in Idaho), the advisory committee felt that this was still a decent turnout given the relatively small size of the Delmarva Peninsula and the number of workshops offered. The reactions from the participants, however, was very similar to other states; namely, that they thought the workshops were useful and timely given the growing interest in farmland protection in their region.

As part of the training project, the advisory committee conducted two evaluations of the training.  The first evaluation was delivered during the workshop and the second one was delivered approximately six weeks later.  According to these evaluations, the workshops were very successful in providing a wide range of training to USDA field personnel that they can then deliver to their constituents at the local level.  Overall, the workshop received an average rating of 8.49 out of a possible 10.  

In addition, 100 percent of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that the workshop gave them a better understanding of the basic elements of farmland protection, and 93 percent of the participants either agreed or strongly agreed that they felt confident that they could assist their communities or organizations in farmland protection efforts. When surveyed two months after the workshops, 83 percent of the respondents had used their workbook at least once in the previous month to answer a farmland protection question.  When asked whether or not they have conducted or plan to conduct workshops, meetings or research using the training that they received, 19 percent said that have used the trainings for these purposes and 57 percent said that they plan to in the future.</text>

          <text>During the small group discussions that took place at the workshops, many participants expressed the need to educate not only USDA field personnel, but also elected officials at the local level.  This was precisely the intent of the training workshop: namely, training participants to provide education and outreach to the next &#8220;level&#8221; of constituents, including elected officials, planners and farmers.  As a result of the interest generated during these workshops, and in conjunction with participants from each of the four training workshops, AFT developed and delivered three additional workshops in the Delmarva Peninsula targeted specifically to local elected officials to educate them on farmland protection and land use techniques. 
 
Approximately 96 elected officials, county and regional planners and other interested groups attended these follow up workshops, which were held in October 2000.   These additional workshops included discussions led by participants of the original workshops and were logical next steps for ensuring that those trained at the original workshops do in fact use the information generated to provide outreach at the local level.  </text>

Methods/Approach

This project was directed by the Delmarva Advisory Committee which was comprised of key agricultural representatives from the region.  The advisory committee was responsible for developing the workshop agenda, identifying speakers and reviewing potential materials for the training workbook.  This committee was instrumental in customizing the training workshop and workbook so that these materials were as relevant as possible to each of the target agencies and organizations.

The advisory committee began meeting in September 1999 to discuss suggestions for the development of this training initiative.  The committee continued to meet through April 2000 to finalize the workshop agenda and training workbook.    
  
Results

There were a total of 92 participants combined for the four workshops.  As part of the training project, the advisory committee conducted two evaluations of the training.  According to these evaluations, the workshops were very successful in providing a wide range of training to USDA field personnel that they can then deliver to their constituents at the local level.  Overall, the workshop received an average rating of 8.49 out of a possible 10.  In addition, 100 percent of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that the workshop gave them a better understanding of the basic elements of farmland protection, and 93 percent of the participants either agreed or strongly agreed that they felt confident that they could assist their communities or organizations in farmland protection efforts. 
  
Impacts and Potential Contributions

During the small group discussions that took place at the workshops, many participants expressed the need to educate not only USDA field personnel, but also elected officials at the local level.  This was precisely the intent of the training workshop: namely, training participants to provide education and outreach to the next &#8220;level&#8221; of constituents, including elected officials, planners and farmers.  As a result of the interest generated during these workshops, and in conjunction with participants of each of the four training workshops, AFT developed and delivered three additional workshops in the Delmarva Peninsula targeted specifically to local elected officials.  These workshops were designed to bring together elected officials so that they could learn more about farmland protection issues and discuss the possibilities for regional solutions.  Roughly 96 county officials, planning staff and others attended these workshops, which were held in October and November 2000.</text>
